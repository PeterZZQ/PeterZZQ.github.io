<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `assets/img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


I'm a Ph.D. student in [the School of Computational Science and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology](https://cse.gatech.edu). My advisor is [Dr. Xiuwei Zhang](https://xiuweizhang.wordpress.com).

I'm generally interested in developing machine learning algorithms to study cell regulatory mechanisms. My main research focuses are:

* Integrating biological information from single-cell multi-omics datasets and single-cell datasets across experimental conditions, and obtaining new biological insight from the integration study.
* Studying cell regulatory mechanisms including gene regulatory network, cross-modalities association network with graph learning algorithms.
